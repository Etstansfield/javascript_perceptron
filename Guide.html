			<h3>How to use the examples:</h3>
			<h4>The Correct Example</h4>
			To start the example first press the "Start Perceptron" button. Then press the "next" button until the perceptron has finished processing.
			If you press the "next" button after the example has finished (this should be with two presses of the next button) you will notice a message
			appear in the error box, which says that there is no further computation to do, the example has finished.<br/><br/>
			<img src="exampleOptions.png" alt="The options for the examples" title="The options for the examples" style="border-style:dotted"> 
			<div style="text-align:center;border-style:none"><i>The options for the examples, notice that the "next" button begins disabled.</i></div>
			<h4>The Incorrect Example</h4>
			The incorrect example operates the same as the correct, except that it does not end in two presses of the next button, instead you will notice 
			that it will go on forever, at some point repeating weight adjustments, this is intentional to show that the perceptron has failed
			to classify the training set.
			<h3>How to use the interactive perceptron:</h3>
			The interactive perceptron can be used much like the example perceptrons, except now you have control over what the parameters for the
			perceptron to operate on including the training patterns, the learning rate, thresholds for the outputs, number of inputs and the delta 
			value.<br/><br/>
			<img src="iterOptions.png" alt="Interactive Perceptron Options" title="Interactive Perceptron Options" style="border-style:dotted">
			<div style="text-align:center;border-style:none"><i>The options for the interactive perceptron, the values in the boxes are the default values.</i></div>
			<img src="inputButtons.png" alt="Input Buttons" title="Input Buttons" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			The add input option at the top adds a input node to the perceptron, when the button is pressed you will notice a new node on the 
			graphical representations of the perceptron and two new weights added to the weight table, as well as another option in the drop-down
			menu for the target patterns. There can only be a maximum of five inputs, if you attempt to add more an error message will appear.<br/><br/>
			The remove input option is much the same but in reverse, when clicked it removes an input node from the graphical representation, 
			removes weights from the weight table and from the target patterns options. The miniumum amount of input nodes is two, this is beacuse any number
			of nodes less than this is trivial.<br/><br/>
			<img src="learnButton.png" alt="Learning Rate and Delta Buttons" title="Learning Rate and Delta Buttons" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			The set learning rate button sets the learning rate to the value in the field to the left of it, by default this is 0.25, changing the learning 
			rate changes the rate by which the weights of connections are modified, higher values result in larger weight changes.
			The learning rate can be modified in increments of 0.01. Once the button has been pressed to change the learning rate, a notice will appear
			in the perceptron output, informing you of the change to the new value.<br/><br/>
			
			To the right of that is the field and button to change the delta value, this is by default 0.0001, and can be changed in increments of the same 
			value. Again, when the button is pressed a notice appears in the perceptron output informing you of the change. The delta value is "how close" to the 
			correct value you want the performace to be, therefore higher values have a larger margin of error and can be expected to stop the perceptron 
			earlier than a smaller value, however caution is adviced as to large a delta value can result in the perceptron not classifying correctly.<br/><br/>
			<img src="thresButton.png" alt="Threshold Buttons" title="Threshold Buttons" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			Below this is are the options to change the thresholds of the output nodes, these are much like the delta or learning rate options, in that there
			is a field where you can change the value of the thresholds (in increments of 0.0001) and a button to set the threshold to the value of the
			field, it also displays a message in the output to notify you of the change, as might be expected, threshold 1 is the threshold for the 
			first output node and threshold 2 for the second, both have a default value of 0, and cannot go below this value.<br/><br/>
			<img src="trainButton.png" alt="Training set Buttons and table" title="Training set Buttons and table" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			Below this is the table displaying both of the training patterns for both outputs, you will notice that they both start with Input 0 already in them,
			this is beacuse input 0 acts as the bias node, and so must be in both, you cannot remove this node from the training patterns.<br/>
			Below that are two drop down menus with two buttons to the right of each these allow you to add and remove input nodes from the training patterns,
			like the fields above pressing the add button will add the value in the field to the pattern, if you attempt to add an input that is already in the 
			pattern an error message will appear. The remove button removes the value in the field from the training pattern, if you attempt to remove a node that
			isn't in the pattern an error message will appear. Also note that if you add an input to either of the patterns and then remove it from the perceptron
			(using the remove input button above), then it will be automatically removed from the target pattern(s).<br/><br/>
			<img src="weightButton.png" alt=" Weight table" title="Weight table" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>

			Below that, there is the weight table, this shows the weights, on the left handside the ones that go to output 1 and on the right, the ones that go to 
			output 2, below them is their current weights, this allows you to have a consise view of the current weights, the perceptron output below shows
			much more detail including which weights have been altered and by how much. These weights initiate to random values.<br/><br/>
			<img src="exampleOptions.png" alt="The options for the interaction" title="The options for the interaction" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			We also have below that, like in the examples the start perceptron and next buttons, these function in exactly the same way as in the examples, except
			that when you press the start perceptron button if you have not added any inputs to the training patterns it will display an error message, this is
			beacuse having only the bias node in the patterns will not work. You cannot start the perceptron without additional nodes in the patterns.
			Once the start perceptron button has been pressed (and additional nodes are in the training patterns) then the next button will become enabled
			and all of the buttons above to modify the parameters will become disabled (so that you cannot modify the parameters while the perceptron is 
			running and cause an error), then like with the examples press the next button until the perceptron stops, however depending on how you set
			up the perceptron it may not stop!<br/><br/>
			<img src="errorExample.png" alt="Example error output" title="Example error output" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			<img src="perOutExample.png" alt="Example Perceptron Output" title="Example Perceptron Output" style="border-style:dotted"><br/>
			Finally below that we have the error output and the perceptron output, the error outputs any errors during the setup and execution of the perceptron,
			it only displays one at a time. The percptron output, on the other hand, is a running log detailing the running of the perceptron, in this way
			you can see the whole execution of the perceptron, from the predictions to the RMS.
